== Explore a POLE dataset
:images: {img}

A **P**ersons **O**bjects **L**ocations **E**vents datamodel focuses on the relationships between people, objects, locations and events and is a model ideal to be used in law enforcement and intelligence investigations.

image::{img}/model.jpeg[float=right,width=200px]

In this guide, you will learn:

* How crime data can be modelled in a graph
* How to query the graph and answer questions using Cypher
* How to refactor your data
* How to use spatial and aggregation functions in Cypher
* How to use the built-in Cypher function shortest path
* How to do conditional matches using the `WHERE` clause


In the next section, you will import the POLE dataset into Neo4j.

== POLE dataset and model

[role=NX_TAB_NAV,tab=import]
pagelaunch::[]

Use the button to import the data into Neo4j.

button::Import POLE[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint=https://neo4j-graph-examples.github.io/pole/data/pole-data-importer.zip]

The public crime data does not include any sort of identifiable information about persons related to crimes, not even as anonymized tokens.
This demo uses street crime data for Greater Manchester, UK from August 2017.

With the data imported, navigate to the `Query` tab to visualize a representation of the graph model by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization()
----

image::{img}/viz.png[float=right,width=200px]

[NOTE]
====
The arrow button icon:ArrowIcon[] copies the query to the clipboard.
The play button icon:PlayIcon[] executes the query and returns the results.
====

You can see that there are 11 different node labels and that these are connected to each other and themselves by various different relationship types.

The `Person` node is especially interesting since it has multiple relationships to itself.
In the dataset, there are more than 300 different `Person` nodes that are related to _each other_ in different ways and not related to themselves.

You will explore the data further in the next step.

== Crimes committed

Using the data model and Cypher, you can answer questions like:

* What type of crimes were committed?
* What is the most common crime?
* What location has the highest crime rate?

You can also look for people and how they relate to each other and to crimes, as you will see in the later steps of this guide.

The following query looks at the nodes with the label `Crime` and uses the built-in aggregation function `count()` to count the number of crimes committed:

.Number of crimes
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Crime)
RETURN labels(c), count(c) AS total
----

 Not all crime is equal and some crimes are more serious than others.
 The following query lets you see the different types of crimes committed and the number of times they were committed by using the `count()` function and ordering the results in descending order:

.Different types of crimes
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Crime)
RETURN c.type AS crime_type, count (c) AS total
ORDER BY count(c) DESC
----

If you recall the graph model, a crime can involve a person, a vehicle or an object.
An object in this dataset is most often evidence and maybe you can guess what these objects may be?

The following query lets you see which crime(s) involved on object and a what the object is:

.Crimes involving an object
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Object)-[:INVOLVED_IN]->(c:Crime)
RETURN c.type AS crime_type, count(c) AS total, o.description AS object
ORDER BY count(c) DESC
----

[NOTE]
.Challenge
====
Can you rewrite the query to show the crimes that involved a person instead of an object, using the `Person` node?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Object)-[:INVOLVED_IN]->(c:Crime)
RETURN c.type AS crime_type, count(c) AS total
ORDER BY count(c) DESC
----

Hint: If you don't remember the data model, you can always run `CALL db.schema.visualization()` to see it again.

====
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(c:Crime)
RETURN c.type AS crime_type, count(c) AS total
ORDER by count(c) DESC
----
====

In the next section you will refactor properties and look at locations in the graph.

== Locations

The `point` data type allows you to use location based functions in Cypher.
Data Importer doesn't support natively creating `point` data types.
In order to work with locations in the POLE dataset, you need to create a `point` property on the `Location` nodes.
Currently the `Location` nodes have a `latitude` and `longitude` property and you can use these to create a `point` property.

.Refactor `Location` nodes
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (l:Location)
SET l.position = point({latitude: l.latitude, longitude: l.longitude})
----

Which locations have the highest crime rate?
The dataset contains a lot of locations, so it is sensible to put a limit on the number of locations returned.

.Locations with the highest crime rate
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (l:Location)<-[:OCCURRED_AT]-(:Crime)
RETURN l.address AS locale, l.postcode AS postcode, count(l) AS total
ORDER BY count(l) DESC
LIMIT 20
----

This query matches locations with crimes returns the `address` and `postcode` properties of the `Location` nodes and counts all non-null occurences of crimes committed at that location and orders the results in descending order.
The `LIMIT` clause limits the number of results returned.

In the next section, you'll use the newly refactored `point` property and Cypher spatial functions.

== Distance

Instead of multiple addresses, you can find out how much and what types of crime were committed in the vicinity of one address.
You can pick any address as your starting point, but for this query you will use an address that may sound familiar.

This is a complex task, so you can break it up.
Start with finding the starting point and give it an alias (`corrie`):

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (l:Location {address: '1 Coronation Street'})
RETURN l.position AS corrie
----

The next step is to locate where the crimes were committed and calculate the distance to Coronation Street:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (l:Location {address: '1 Coronation Street'})
WITH l.position AS corrie
MATCH (x:Location)<-[:OCCURRED_AT]-(c:Crime)
RETURN x.address as crime_location, point.distance(x.position, corrie) AS distanceFromCoronationSt
----
Since you are interested in crimes committed in the _vicinity_ of Coronation Street, it makes sense to filter the results and leave out locations farther than 500 meters.
Additionally, it would interesting to see what types of crimes they are.
The next step is therefore to filter out all criminal locations > 500 meters and aggregate the crime types in the return clause:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (l:Location {address: '1 Coronation Street'})
WITH l.position AS corrie
MATCH (x:Location)<-[:OCCURRED_AT]-(c:Crime)
WITH x, c, point.distance(x.position, corrie) AS distance
WHERE distance < 500
RETURN x.address AS address, count(c) AS crime_total, collect(c.type) AS crime_type, distance
----

The last things you need to do is to order the criminal addresses by their distance from Coronation Street and return only the ten closest addresses:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (l:Location {address: '1 Coronation Street'})
WITH l.position AS corrie
MATCH (x:Location)<-[:OCCURRED_AT]-(c:Crime)
WITH x, c, point.distance(x.position, corrie) AS distance
WHERE distance < 500
RETURN x.address AS address, count(c) AS crime_total, collect(c.type) AS crime_type, distance
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 10
----

Now you have a neat table of locations, how many and what type of crimes were committed, and the distance to 1 Coronation Street.

[NOTE]
.Challenge
====
Can you find the address farthest away from 1 Coronation St and find out what types of crimes have been committed there?

Keep in mind that you don't want to limit the distance in this query.
====

[%collapsible]
.Reveal the solution
====
The address farthest away from 1 Coronation St is 156 The Beacons and the crime types are "Violence and sexual offences" and "Drugs".
This is a query to find this information:
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (l:Location {address: '1 Coronation Street'})
WITH point(l) AS corrie
MATCH (x:Location)<-[:OCCURRED_AT]-(c:Crime)
WITH x, c, point.distance(point(x), corrie) AS distance
RETURN x.address AS address, count(c) AS crime_total, collect(c.type) AS crime_type, distance
ORDER BY distance DESC
LIMIT 1
----
====

In the next section, you will look at people in the graph.

== Find people

There are two different types of people in the graph, `Person` and `Officer`.
A person can be party to a crime or related to (in one or more hops) a person party to a crime and a crime can be investigated by an officer.

The following query shows what one Inspector Morse is working on:

.Crimes investigated by Inspector Morse
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Officer {surname: 'Morse'})<-[i:INVESTIGATED_BY]-(c:Crime)
RETURN *
----

[NOTE]
.Challenge
====
Write a Cypher query to find a different officer named Devy Larive and the crimes he's _currently_ investigating.
Find out which type of crime is most common among his open cases.

Hint: The `Crime` nodes have a property called `last_outcome` and you are interested in the ones that are `Under investigation`.
====

[%collapsible]
.Reveal the solution
====
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Crime {last_outcome: 'Under investigation'})-[i:INVESTIGATED_BY]->(o:Officer {surname: 'Larive'})
RETURN c.type AS type, count(c) AS number
ORDER BY count(c) DESC
----

This should tell you that Officer Larive is currently investigating three Drug crimes
====

If you use this information, you can run the following query to bring back only cases under investigation on the drug category.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Crime {type:'Drugs', last_outcome: 'Under investigation'})-[i:INVESTIGATED_BY]->(o:Officer {surname: 'Larive'})
return *
----

You can double-click on the crime nodes in the graph to expand them and see if any of them share anything else.
Can you see any new connections after expanding?

Whereas you could keep manually clicking and expanding on the graph, you could also write some queries that are more targeted.

In the next section, you will look closer at paths.

== Find paths

In the last section you probably found that two of the crimes were connected by a person named Jack Powell and the third crime was connected to a person named Raymond Walker.
If you looked even closer at the crime nodes, you saw that the crimes associated with Jack had a charge of cannabis possession and Raymond's had a charge of cannabis production.

Perhaps Jack Powell and Raymond Walker are part of a larger network?

The following Cypher query finds all the shortest paths between Jack and Raymond using the built-in algorithm _allShortestPaths_:

.All shortest paths
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = allshortestpaths((p1:Person {name:'Jack', surname:'Powell'})-[:KNOWS|KNOWS_LW|KNOWS_SN|FAMILY_REL|KNOWS_PHONE*..3]-(p2:Person{name:'Raymond', surname:'Walker'}))
RETURN path
----

The result looks like a small social group of six people who are closely related, some in the same family.

Since you know that Jack and Raymond are connected by Officer Larive, maybe there is a larger network.
Consider the following query and see if you can think of what insights you can draw from the results:

.Other related people
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (:Officer {surname:'Larive'})<-[:INVESTIGATED_BY]-(:Crime {type: 'Drugs'})<-[:PARTY_TO]-(:Person)-[:KNOWS*..3]-(:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime {type: 'Drugs'})
RETURN path
----

The query finds people associated with drug crimes investigated by Officer Larive that are with three hops away from each other along the `:KNOWS` relationship.

Note that there are other relationships present in the returned graph, apart from `:KNOWS`, `:PARTY_TO`, and `:INVESTIGATED_BY` that are specified in the query.
Why do you think that is?

A clue would be that wherever there is different type of relationship, there is also one of the specified relationships.

[NOTE]
.Challenge
====
Does a similar network exist in any of the cases Inspector Morse is investigating?
====

[%collapsible]
.Reveal the solution
====
The answer is no since there are no `Person` nodes connected to Inspector Morse.
One way you can check this is by the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (:Officer {surname:'Morse'})<-[:INVESTIGATED_BY]-(:Crime)<-[:PARTY_TO]-(:Person)
RETURN path
----
====

In the next section, you will use the `WHERE` clause to find vulnerable people.

== Conditional matches

Not all people in the dataset are directly related to a crime, but they may know many people who are.
People in the middle of a network of criminals without themselves being criminal can be considered as vulnerable and at risk.
Finding them can be of interest for social services or child protection.

To find the most vulnerable people in the graph, consider the following query:

.Find people NOT directly related to a crime
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(friend)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime)
WHERE NOT (p:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime)
RETURN p.name AS name, p.surname AS surname, count(distinct friend) AS dangerousFriends
ORDER BY dangerousFriends DESC
LIMIT 5
----

The `WHERE NOT` clause filters out all person nodes with a direct relation to a crime.
In a real scenario, you would want more information about the person, such as an ID number.

[NOTE]
.Challenge
====
Sometimes even friends of friends can have influence on a person.
Can you modify the previous query to include friends up to 3 hops away in the result?
====

[%collapsible]
.Reveal the solution
====
[source,cypher]
MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS*1..2]-(friend)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime)
WHERE NOT (p:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime)
RETURN p.name AS name, p.surname AS surname, count(distinct friend) AS dangerousFriends
ORDER BY dangerousFriends DESC
LIMIT 5
====

You can expand a vulnerable person's graph with the following query:

.Vulnerable person's friends
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (:Location)<-[:CURRENT_ADDRESS]-(:Person {name: 'Anne', surname: 'Freeman'})-[:KNOWS*1..2]-(:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime)
RETURN path
----

In the next section, you will look for dangerous family friends.

== Fine-tune your matches

You can fine-tune your query to look for vulnerable people based on their family relationships instead of just the generic `KNOWS` (as you can see in the graph, `Person` are connected with double relationships, `KNOWS` and a more specific one).

The following query finds a person not directly related to a crime, who has a non-criminal family member with dangerous friends:

.Dangerous family friends
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:FAMILY_REL]-(relative)-[:KNOWS]-(famFriend)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime)
WHERE NOT (p:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime) AND
 NOT (relative)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime)
RETURN p.name AS name, p.surname AS surname, count(DISTINCT famFriend) AS DangerousFamilyFriends
ORDER BY DangerousFamilyFriends DESC
LIMIT 5
----

Third parties can have varied influence on vulnerable individuals, but the degree of influence could increase if the vulnerable person lives with the relative who has dangerous friends.

[NOTE]
.Challenge
====
Can you complete this query to find the top five vulnerable people who live at the same address as their non-criminal relative with dangerous friends?
Replace the relationship type(s) and node label on line 2.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:FAMILY_REL]-(relative)-[:KNOWS]-(famFriend)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime),
(p)-[a relationship here]->(a node here)<-[a relationship]-(relative)
WHERE NOT (p:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime) AND
 NOT (relative)-[:PARTY_TO]->(:Crime)
RETURN p.name AS name, p.surname AS surname, p.nhs_no AS id, count(DISTINCT famFriend) AS DangerousFamilyFriends
ORDER BY DangerousFamilyFriends DESC
LIMIT 5
----

Line 2 of the query should look like this:
